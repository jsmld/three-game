## About

When it comes to the web, I've always been interested in 3D stuff but I've been nervous about where to start.
I'm someone that likes to start from the beginning but graphics and 3D has always been a bit of a mystery for me.
Three.js is my solution to this problem; a way where I can enter in with minimal friction and also start to understand
how things work by digging into the internals. Right now I am going to make a small game, but my long-term goal is to create
a 3D online learning platform with game-like elements. For now.... baby steps!

## What is this?

My adventure building a small game made using three.js. I'm currently using a mix of documentation and tutorials for direction.

## How can I see what you've done so far?

You can pull down the code onto your local machine. Assuming that you have Node installed; you can run the following commands from the root of the repo:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Isn't there a blog or something where you will document this process?

Ugh I'm getting there alright? It will happen, don't worry.
