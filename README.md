# three-game

When it comes to the web, I've always been interested in 3D stuff but I've been nervous about where to start.
I'm someone that likes to start from the beginning but graphics and 3D has always been a bit of a mystery for me.
Three.js is my solution to this problem; a way where I can enter in with minimal friction and also start to understand
how things work by digging into the internals. Right now I am going to make a small game, but my long-term goal is to create
a 3D online learning platform with game-like elements. For now.... baby steps!
